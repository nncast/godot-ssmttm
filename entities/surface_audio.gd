## Gives a player footsteps that match the tile they're standing on, plus the
## ocean loop that swells as they get near the water. Add as a child of a
## Tubig or Sili - both create one in their own _ready().
##
## Surface detection reads the level's TileMapLayers directly rather than
## keeping a parallel "what's the ground here" map, so it can never fall out
## of sync with a hand-edited level: whatever layer you painted a tile on is
## what you hear. Layers are tested in SURFACE_LAYERS order and the first one
## with a tile at the player's cell wins, so a road painted over sand sounds
## like road.
##
## Footsteps are positional (AudioStreamPlayer2D) so you can hear another
## player running past you, which matters a lot in a hide-and-seek game.
## The ambience is non-positional and only runs for the player you're
## actually controlling.

## Layer node path under the level's Map node -> surface name. Order is
## priority, most specific ground first. Add a row here when you add a layer.
